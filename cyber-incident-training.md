# Maintaining Incident Response “Currency” with Scenario-Based Team Training

## Executive Summary
Commercial aviation requires recurrent training and checkrides every six months to keep flight crews safe and sharp. Cyber defenders deserve the same rigor. This paper proposes an **aviation-inspired incident response (IR) currency program** for **enterprise SOCs and retail-focused MSSPs**, centered on **scenario-based simulations**, **team communication discipline**, and **recurrent cadence**. The framework reinforces four priority domains—**Identity**, **Network**, **Endpoint/Forensics**, and **Recovery/Reporting & Third-Party Management**—and maps directly to **NIST SP 800-53 Rev.5 IR-2/IR-3** controls and **MITRE ATT&CK**.

---

## Rationale: Why Recurrent IR “Currency” Matters
- **Threat evolution + skill atrophy:** Techniques change faster than static playbooks; unpracticed skills fade. Recurrent drills maintain “muscle memory” for contain-eradicate-recover sequences and decision-making under stress (*NIST SP 800-53 IR-2/IR-3* advocate role-based **training** and periodic **testing**, including simulated events). [1][2]  
- **Retail risk profile:** Retailers face high-tempo, high-impact events (POS/store operations, e-commerce, loyalty accounts, 3P integrations). Recent sector reports show persistent ransomware pressure and operational disruption. [11][12]  
- **Human factors:** Aviation’s **Crew Resource Management (CRM)** demonstrates that **structured comms, clear roles, and empowered teamwork** reduce error in time-critical operations. These principles translate directly to IR teamwork. [6][13]

---

## Program Goals
1. **Maintain responder currency** (biannual “checkride” minimum; quarterly preferred) aligned with IR roles.  
2. **Reinforce team-based execution** (role clarity, comms discipline, resource management).  
3. **Exercise end-to-end lifecycles** from detection through validated recovery and stakeholder handoff.  
4. **Evidence compliance** with NIST SP 800-53 IR-2/IR-3 and PCI-DSS 12.10.x (for retail payment environments). [1][2][8][9][10]

---

## Roles & Team Structure (four-person “digital fireteam”)
- **Commander/Senior (IC):** validates threat, sets priorities, manages comms and tempo.  
- **Endpoint Lead:** isolation, host triage, memory/disk artifacts, persistence & eradication.  
- **Network Analyst:** C2/exfil detection, lateral tracing, segmentation/blocks.  
- **Identity Defender:** account activity, MFA/session hygiene, token abuse, privilege changes.

Rotate roles across drills to build redundancy and leadership depth.

---

## Communication Discipline (CRM for IR)
- **Standard call phrases & brevity:** “Host *POS-03* isolated 14:32Z; RAM capture started.”  
- **Timed check-ins:** 5-minute status cadence during hot phases.  
- **Closed-loop comms:** confirmations required on directives; ambiguity eliminated.  
- **Psychological safety:** any team member can call risk or surface dissenting evidence (flattened hierarchy).  
(*CRM/AC-120-51D guidance adapted to cyber response.*) [6][13]

---

## Training Cadence (“Flight Hours” for IR)
- **Quarterly scenario exercises** (tabletop → functional/cyber-range), each focused on a different primary domain and threat path.  
- **Biannual comprehensive “checkride”:** end-to-end technical + command/comms evaluation.  
- **Annual full-scale exercise** with cross-functions (IT, Legal, PR, Risk) and external partners (MSSP, key vendors, payment processors).  
(Addresses **IR-2 training** frequency and **IR-3 testing** requirements; supports **PCI-DSS 12.10.x**.) [1][2][8][9][10]

## Core Skill Domains & Scenario Patterns

### 1) Identity & Access Incidents
**Objectives:** detect and mitigate credential abuse, privilege escalation, MFA/session compromise.  
**Scenario seeds:**  
- Brute-force/credential-stuffing spike followed by successful logins from atypical geo.  
- Push-fatigue MFA + session token reuse; privileged group membership changes.  
**Key actions:** review sign-in telemetry, revoke sessions, reset credentials, contain risky apps, revert privilege changes.  
**ATT&CK focus:** **Credential Access / Privilege Escalation / Persistence** (e.g., **T1078 Valid Accounts**, **T1003 OS Credential Dumping** when host data indicates theft). [3][5][7]

### 2) Network Defense & Containment
**Objectives:** recognize C2/exfil patterns, implement rapid segmentation/blocks, trace lateral movement.  
**Scenario seeds:**  
- Beaconing to rare external ASN; protocol/port mismatch; DNS tunneling indicators.  
- Abnormal East-West spikes; SMB/RDP sweep beginning from a compromised jump host.  
**Key actions:** push egress/IDS blocks, quarantine segments, collect PCAP/flow logs, enumerate affected peers, coordinate with MSSP for managed edge controls.  
**ATT&CK focus:** **Command & Control / Lateral Movement**. (Exercise with Zeek/flow telemetry for realistic workflow.) [4][14][15]

### 3) Endpoint Forensics & Host Mitigation
**Objectives:** accelerate host triage, find persistence, eradicate safely, confirm clean state.  
**Scenario seeds:**  
- POS server with RAM-scraper indicators; scheduled task persistence.  
- Ransomware pre-encryption foothold detected by EDR (suspicious LOLBin chain).  
**Key actions:** isolate host, capture memory/timeline, enumerate persistence (services, tasks, Run keys), kill processes, remove artifacts, redeploy hardening.  
**ATT&CK focus:** **Execution / Persistence / Privilege Escalation / Defense Evasion** (e.g., **T1053 Scheduled Task**, **T1003**). [3][5]

### 4) Recovery, Reporting, & Third-Party Coordination
**Objectives:** validated restore, stakeholder reporting, coordinated vendor/MSSP actions.  
**Scenario seeds:**  
- Restore of payment-adjacent system from backups; validate no backdoors.  
- Supplier compromise with joint containment steps and contractual comms.  
**Key actions:** clean-state verification, integrity checks, executive/PCI reporting artifacts, lessons-learned capture, vendor handoffs.  
**Compliance touchpoints:** **PCI-DSS 12.10.x** testing, training, 24/7 availability, and plan evolution. [8][9][10]

## Scenario Design Blueprint (per exercise)
| Element | Guidance |
|---|---|
| **Objective(s)** | Choose 1–2 primary domains + 1 secondary (e.g., Identity primary + Network secondary). |
| **ATT&CK Mapping** | List targeted Tactics/Techniques (IDs) to ensure threat-informed coverage rotation. |
| **Artifacts & Telemetry** | Prepare auth logs, EDR timelines, Zeek/flow, packet slices, email headers, IR templates. |
| **Injects** | Time-boxed surprises (e.g., new IOC set, dark-web extortion post, vendor alert). |
| **Roles** | Assign Commander, Endpoint, Network, Identity; designate Comms scribe. |
| **Success Criteria** | Time-to-detect, time-to-contain, correctness of eradication, comms clarity, recovery validation. |
| **Debrief** | Technical findings + team dynamics “hotwash”; update playbooks/SOPs and PCI/NIST evidence. |

## Compliance & Framework Alignment

### NIST SP 800-53 Rev.5
- **IR-2 (Incident Response Training):** role-based training on defined intervals; **IR-2(1)** recommends **simulated events**. [1]  
- **IR-3 (Incident Response Testing):** periodic testing to evaluate effectiveness; coordinate with related plans; drive **continuous improvement**. [2]

### NIST SP 800-61 (Incident Handling Guide)
- Endorses use of **tabletops and simulations** to validate process/roles and improve detection-through-recovery execution. [16][17]

### PCI-DSS (Retail relevance)
- **12.10.1–12.10.6:** incident response plan **implemented, reviewed/updated/tested at least annually**, 24/7 personnel availability, **role-specific periodic training**, monitoring/alert response, and plan evolution via lessons learned and emerging threats. [8][9][10][18]

### MITRE ATT&CK (Threat-informed training)
- Map scenarios to relevant **tactics/techniques** (e.g., **T1078 Valid Accounts**, **T1003 OS Credential Dumping**) and rotate coverage; include sector-salient adversaries like **FIN8** (retail/hospitality targeting). [3][5]

---

## MSSP Integration (Retail Sector)
- **Joint exercises:** include MSSP analysts in quarterly drills; rehearse **escalation, evidence transfer, change control** and **rapid control deployment** across managed edges.  
- **Playbook harmonization:** standardize ATT&CK-mapped playbooks and comms formats between enterprise and MSSP; pre-approve emergency network rulesets.  
- **Evidence & reporting:** MSSP contributes logs, timelines, and executive summaries aligned to enterprise templates and regulatory needs.

---

## Metrics & Continuous Improvement
- **Lag metrics:** time-to-detect, time-to-contain, mean time to revoke sessions/kill C2, restore validation elapsed.  
- **Quality metrics:** eradication completeness (persistence removed), ATT&CK coverage, comms clarity (closed-loop %, missed confirmations).  
- **Program health:** currency attainment by role, scenario rotation coverage, playbook updates per quarter, PCI/NIST evidence completeness.

---

## Sample 12-Month Rotation (Retail-biased)
1. **Q1:** Identity (**T1078**, cloud SSO signals).  
2. **Q2:** Pre-encryption ransomware foothold on store server; lateral via RDP; segmented recovery.  
3. **Q3:** Web-skimmer on e-commerce; CDN/log triage; coordinated takedown with vendor.  
4. **Q4:** Supplier-origin intrusion; third-party incident bridge; contractual comms; payment processor notifications.  
**Biannual Checkrides:** blend of technical hands-on + command/comms assessment tied to IR-2/IR-3 evidence.

---

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Leadership approval; designate cadence & scope (quarterly + biannual checkride).  
- [ ] Role matrix & comms SOP (CRM-style phraseology; timed check-ins).  
- [ ] Scenario library with ATT&CK mapping and sector specificity (retail).  
- [ ] Artifact packs (EDR, Zeek/flow, auth logs, PCAP slices, reporting templates).  
- [ ] MSSP/vendor participation plan and emergency change approvals.  
- [ ] Debrief template → SOP/playbook updates → PCI/NIST evidence filing.

---

## Conclusion
Aviation proved that **recurrent, scenario-based training** saves lives by converting procedures into reflexes and teams into **cohesive, communicative crews**. Applying the same discipline to IR in retail enterprises and MSSPs elevates readiness, compresses response timelines, and improves outcomes—while **demonstrably meeting NIST and PCI expectations**. Make currency a requirement, not a hope.

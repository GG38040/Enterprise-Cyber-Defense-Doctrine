## Preface: Why a Cyber Defense Doctrine Matters

Cybersecurity today is often overshadowed by discussions of tools and technologies. Yet, true resilience emerges not from the latest software, but from **doctrine**: the guiding principles, organizational beliefs, and enduring practices that align defense actions to business objectives. 

This project is **open source** and designed for adaptation. Practitioners, SOC leaders, CISOs, and executives are encouraged to fork, tailor, and contribute back improvements. This manual provides a comprehensive framework—rooted in first principles—for enterprises to craft a Cyber Defense Doctrine that integrates **People, Processes, and Capability** into business-aligned outcomes.

---

## Chapter 1: Philosophy and First Principles

- **Doctrine over Tools:** Technology is transient; doctrine provides the enduring compass.
- **Business Alignment:** Cybersecurity must protect and enable core business functions.
- **Resilience as Strategy:** Cyber outcomes are measured in business continuity, trust, and adaptability.
- **Continuous Learning:** Practitioners are lifelong learners.

> **First Principle:** Security actions must always align with, and enable, the mission of the business.

---

## Chapter 2: People – Workforce Development and Career Pathing

Drawing on the NICE Workforce Framework (NIST SP 800-181r1):

- **Competency-Based Roles:** Define work in terms of **Tasks, Knowledge, and Skills (TKS)**.
- **Career Pathways:** Entry → Apprentice → Practitioner → Expert → Leader.
- **Continuous Upskilling:** Emphasize cloud, AI, secure coding, and CTEM readiness.
- **Practical Guidance:**
  - Hire for aptitude and potential not just hard skills and degrees.
  - Balance generalists (SOC) with specialists.
  - Build diversity as a resilience multiplier.

**Visual Suggestion:** Career Path Pyramid showing growth from foundational analyst to strategic leader.

**Field Card – Workforce Development**

| Action | Principle |
|--------|-----------|
| Hire   | Focus on competencies |
| Upskill| Continuous learning in emerging domains |
| Diversify | Build diverse teams for resilience |
| Align | Tie roles to business outcomes |

---

## Chapter 3: Processes – Foundational Cybersecurity Outcomes

Built on NIST CSF 2.0 Functions (Govern, Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover):

- **Govern:** Cyber risk appetite tied to enterprise risk management.
- **Identify:** Asset inventories mapped to business functions.
- **Protect:** Embed zero trust, encryption, MFA as baselines.
- **Detect:** Continuous monitoring and threat exposure management (CTEM).
- **Respond:** Containment decisions made like medical triage—balancing risk vs. business impact.
- **Recover:** Transparent communication and rapid restoration of business services.

**Visual Suggestion:** CSF Wheel with Business Alignment Layer.

**Field Card – Core Processes**

| Function | Focus |
|----------|-------|
| Govern   | Define risk appetite, integrate with ERM |
| Identify | Inventory and map assets to business value |
| Protect  | Apply layered safeguards (MFA, ZT, encryption) |
| Detect   | Continuous monitoring and anomaly detection |
| Respond  | Triage and contain without harming business |
| Recover  | Restore trust, services, and confidence |

---

## Chapter 4: Capability – Aligning Outcomes with Business Strategy

Capabilities = People + Process + Technology → Outcomes.

- **Capabilities as Business Enablers:** Frame security outcomes in business terms (e.g., "ensuring uptime of digital payments" or "protecting customer trust").
- **Teams, not Tools:** Use NICE Work Role models to design team compositions.
- **AI as a Co-Pilot:** Analysts augmented by AI.
- **CTEM Integration:** Benchmark, emulate adversaries, remediate, re-test.

**Visual Suggestion:** Venn diagram of People, Process, Technology intersecting to create Business-Aligned Capability.

**Field Card – Capability Doctrine**

| Action | Guideline |
|--------|-----------|
| Frame  | Express outcomes in business language |
| Team   | Build capability through teams, not tools |
| Augment | Use AI responsibly as co-pilot |
| Test   | Benchmark continuously with CTEM |

---

## Chapter 5: Governance and Risk Alignment

- **Executive Buy-in:** Cybersecurity as a business-wide priority.
- **Risk Appetite & Tolerance:** Explicit statements approved by leadership.
- **Integration with ERM:** Cybersecurity risk is enterprise risk.
- **Supply Chain Risk Management:** Incorporate C-SCRM (NIST SP 800-161r1) into doctrine.

**Visual Suggestion:** Governance Flow (Board → Execs → Managers → Practitioners).

**Field Card – Governance**

| Action | Priority |
|--------|----------|
| Align  | Cybersecurity = Enterprise risk |
| Define | Establish risk appetite & tolerance |
| Integrate | Embed into ERM processes |
| Oversee | Monitor supply chain risk |

---

## Chapter 6: Operationalizing the Doctrine

- **Doctrine → Strategy → Action:** Doctrine informs strategies; strategies shape operations.
- **CSF Profiles & Tiers:** Use Current vs. Target Profiles to assess maturity and close gaps.
- **Metrics:**
  - **Time-to-Detect (TTD):** Target < 24 hours
  - **Time-to-Respond (TTR):** Target < 12 hours
  - **Mean Time-to-Recover (MTTR):** Target < 48 hours
- **Playbooks:** Ensure containment and recovery decisions align with business continuity.

**Visual Suggestion:** Maturity Roadmap from Tier 1 (Ad Hoc) to Tier 4 (Adaptive).

**Field Card – Operationalization**

| Action | Tool |
|--------|-----|
| Assess | Compare Current vs Target Profiles |
| Mature | Apply CSF Tiers as roadmap |
| Measure| Track TTD, TTR, MTTR |
| Execute| Run tested playbooks |

---

## Chapter 7: Continuous Renewal and Benchmarking

- **Review Cycle:** Doctrine updated annually; strategies quarterly.
- **Red Teaming:** Simulate real-world adversaries.
- **Benchmarking:** Against peers, global reports, and CTEM frameworks.
- **Feedback Loop:** Lessons learned feed back into People, Process, and Capability pillars.

**Visual Suggestion:** Closed-loop Continuous Renewal Cycle.

**Field Card – Renewal**

| Action | Frequency |
|--------|-----------|
| Refresh | Annually – doctrine review |
| Update  | Quarterly – strategy adjustments |
| Test    | Continuous red team exercises |
| Learn   | Feed lessons into doctrine |

---

## Field Cards: Practitioner Quick-Reference Guides

Each Field Card distills doctrine into actionable checklists:

1. **Workforce Development** – Hire, Upskill, Diversify, Align.
2. **Core Processes** – Govern, Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover.
3. **Capability Doctrine** – Business Outcomes, Team-driven, AI Co-pilot, Benchmarking.
4. **Governance** – Executive Buy-in, Risk Appetite, ERM Integration, Supply Chain.
5. **Operationalization** – Profiles, Tiers, Metrics, Playbooks.
6. **Continuous Renewal** – Refresh, Update, Red Team, Feedback Loop.

# Appendix — NIST CSF 2.0 Crosswalk

This appendix maps the **Enterprise Cyber Defense Doctrine** to the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0**.  
Use it as a reference when building Profiles (Current/Target), setting Tiers, and prioritizing work.

> **Scope:** CSF 2.0 Functions (GV, ID, PR, DE, RS, RC), Categories (e.g., GV.RM), and representative Subcategories where helpful.  
> **Notes:** The Doctrine is outcome-oriented and business-aligned; CSF is outcome taxonomy. Multiple-to-multiple mappings are expected.

## How to Use the Crosswalk

1. **Scope a Profile** (product line, business service, or threat scenario).  
2. **Bind Doctrine chapter goals** to the CSF Categories above.  
3. **Select Subcategories** as measurable outcomes; add your **Informative References** (e.g., 800-53, ISO 27001).  
4. **Set Tier targets** for GOVERN + the other Functions.  
5. **Run gap analysis → POA&M → Measure → Improve (ID.IM)**.

> **Source reference:** NIST CSF 2.0 (Feb 26, 2024) Functions, Categories, Subcategories; Profiles & Tiers.

**Crosswalk Example:**

| Doctrine Pillar | NIST CSF Function |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| People          | Govern, Protect   |
| Process         | Identify, Detect, Respond, Recover |
| Capability      | Govern, Protect, Detect, Respond |

## Case Study Example (Notional)

**Scenario:** A global retailer detects ransomware spreading in its POS systems. 

- **Containment (Doctrine):** SOC analysts apply triage—contain POS systems regionally rather than globally to minimize business disruption.
- **Business Outcome:** Transactions in unaffected regions continue, protecting revenue streams.
- **Lesson:** Applying medical-triage style doctrine avoids unnecessary enterprise-wide shutdowns.

---

**Closing Thought:** A Cyber Defense Doctrine is not static—it is a **living covenant** between practitioners and the business. It ensures cybersecurity is not a blocker, but an enabler of mission success.

## Preface: Why a Cyber Defense Doctrine Matters

Cybersecurity today is often overshadowed by discussions of tools and technologies. Yet, true resilience emerges not from the latest software, but from **doctrine**: the guiding principles, organizational beliefs, and enduring practices that align defense actions to business objectives. 

This project is **open source** and designed for adaptation. Practitioners, SOC leaders, CISOs, and executives are encouraged to fork, tailor, and contribute back improvements. This manual provides a comprehensive framework—rooted in first principles—for enterprises to craft a Cyber Defense Doctrine that integrates **People, Processes, and Capability** into business-aligned outcomes.

---

## Chapter 1: Philosophy and First Principles

- **Doctrine over Tools:** Technology is transient; doctrine provides the enduring compass.
- **Business Alignment:** Cybersecurity must protect and enable core business functions.
- **Resilience as Strategy:** Cyber outcomes are measured in business continuity, trust, and adaptability.
- **Continuous Learning:** Practitioners are lifelong learners.

> **First Principle:** Security actions must always align with, and enable, the mission of the business.

---

## Chapter 2: People – Workforce Development and Career Pathing

Drawing on the NICE Workforce Framework (NIST SP 800-181r1):

- **Competency-Based Roles:** Define work in terms of **Tasks, Knowledge, and Skills (TKS)**.
- **Career Pathways:** Entry → Apprentice → Practitioner → Expert → Leader.
- **Continuous Upskilling:** Emphasize cloud, AI, secure coding, and CTEM readiness.
- **Practical Guidance:**
  - Hire for aptitude and potential not just hard skills and degrees.
  - Balance generalists (SOC) with specialists.
  - Build diversity as a resilience multiplier.

**Visual Suggestion:** Career Path Pyramid showing growth from foundational analyst to strategic leader.

**Field Card – Workforce Development**

| Action | Principle |
|--------|-----------|
| Hire   | Focus on competencies |
| Upskill| Continuous learning in emerging domains |
| Diversify | Build diverse teams for resilience |
| Align | Tie roles to business outcomes |

---

## Chapter 3: Processes – Foundational Cybersecurity Outcomes

Built on NIST CSF 2.0 Functions (Govern, Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover):

- **Govern:** Cyber risk appetite tied to enterprise risk management.
- **Identify:** Asset inventories mapped to business functions.
- **Protect:** Embed zero trust, encryption, MFA as baselines.
- **Detect:** Continuous monitoring and threat exposure management (CTEM).
- **Respond:** Containment decisions made like medical triage—balancing risk vs. business impact.
- **Recover:** Transparent communication and rapid restoration of business services.

**Visual Suggestion:** CSF Wheel with Business Alignment Layer.

**Field Card – Core Processes**

| Function | Focus |
|----------|-------|
| Govern   | Define risk appetite, integrate with ERM |
| Identify | Inventory and map assets to business value |
| Protect  | Apply layered safeguards (MFA, ZT, encryption) |
| Detect   | Continuous monitoring and anomaly detection |
| Respond  | Triage and contain without harming business |
| Recover  | Restore trust, services, and confidence |

---

## Chapter 4: Capability – Aligning Outcomes with Business Strategy

Capabilities = People + Process + Technology → Outcomes.

- **Capabilities as Business Enablers:** Frame security outcomes in business terms (e.g., "ensuring uptime of digital payments" or "protecting customer trust").
- **Teams, not Tools:** Use NICE Work Role models to design team compositions.
- **AI as a Co-Pilot:** Analysts augmented by AI.
- **CTEM Integration:** Benchmark, emulate adversaries, remediate, re-test.

**Visual Suggestion:** Venn diagram of People, Process, Technology intersecting to create Business-Aligned Capability.

**Field Card – Capability Doctrine**

| Action | Guideline |
|--------|-----------|
| Frame  | Express outcomes in business language |
| Team   | Build capability through teams, not tools |
| Augment | Use AI responsibly as co-pilot |
| Test   | Benchmark continuously with CTEM |

---

## Chapter 5: Governance and Risk Alignment

- **Executive Buy-in:** Cybersecurity as a business-wide priority.
- **Risk Appetite & Tolerance:** Explicit statements approved by leadership.
- **Integration with ERM:** Cybersecurity risk is enterprise risk.
- **Supply Chain Risk Management:** Incorporate C-SCRM (NIST SP 800-161r1) into doctrine.

**Visual Suggestion:** Governance Flow (Board → Execs → Managers → Practitioners).

**Field Card – Governance**

| Action | Priority |
|--------|----------|
| Align  | Cybersecurity = Enterprise risk |
| Define | Establish risk appetite & tolerance |
| Integrate | Embed into ERM processes |
| Oversee | Monitor supply chain risk |

---

## Chapter 6: Operationalizing the Doctrine

- **Doctrine → Strategy → Action:** Doctrine informs strategies; strategies shape operations.
- **CSF Profiles & Tiers:** Use Current vs. Target Profiles to assess maturity and close gaps.
- **Metrics:**
  - **Time-to-Detect (TTD):** Target < 24 hours
  - **Time-to-Respond (TTR):** Target < 12 hours
  - **Mean Time-to-Recover (MTTR):** Target < 48 hours
- **Playbooks:** Ensure containment and recovery decisions align with business continuity.

**Visual Suggestion:** Maturity Roadmap from Tier 1 (Ad Hoc) to Tier 4 (Adaptive).

**Field Card – Operationalization**

| Action | Tool |
|--------|-----|
| Assess | Compare Current vs Target Profiles |
| Mature | Apply CSF Tiers as roadmap |
| Measure| Track TTD, TTR, MTTR |
| Execute| Run tested playbooks |

---

## Chapter 7: Continuous Renewal and Benchmarking

- **Review Cycle:** Doctrine updated annually; strategies quarterly.
- **Red Teaming:** Simulate real-world adversaries.
- **Benchmarking:** Against peers, global reports, and CTEM frameworks.
- **Feedback Loop:** Lessons learned feed back into People, Process, and Capability pillars.

**Visual Suggestion:** Closed-loop Continuous Renewal Cycle.

**Field Card – Renewal**

| Action | Frequency |
|--------|-----------|
| Refresh | Annually – doctrine review |
| Update  | Quarterly – strategy adjustments |
| Test    | Continuous red team exercises |
| Learn   | Feed lessons into doctrine |

---

## Field Cards: Practitioner Quick-Reference Guides

Each Field Card distills doctrine into actionable checklists:

1. **Workforce Development** – Hire, Upskill, Diversify, Align.
2. **Core Processes** – Govern, Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover.
3. **Capability Doctrine** – Business Outcomes, Team-driven, AI Co-pilot, Benchmarking.
4. **Governance** – Executive Buy-in, Risk Appetite, ERM Integration, Supply Chain.
5. **Operationalization** – Profiles, Tiers, Metrics, Playbooks.
6. **Continuous Renewal** – Refresh, Update, Red Team, Feedback Loop.

## Appendices

- **Appendix A:** NICE Framework Alignment (Tasks, Knowledge, Skills).

title: Appendix A — NICE Framework Alignment (Tasks, Knowledge, Skills)
description: How the Enterprise Cyber Defense Doctrine implements the NICE Framework’s TKS building blocks, Competencies, Work Roles, and Teams.
---

# Appendix A — NICE Framework Alignment (Tasks, Knowledge, Skills)

This appendix shows **how to operationalize the Doctrine’s People pillar** using the **NICE Framework (NIST SP 800-181r1)** and its modern, modular building blocks: **Tasks (T)**, **Knowledge (K)**, and **Skills (S)** — together “**TKS**.” The NICE refactor deprecates prior **Categories/Specialty Areas** in favor of agile, interoperable **TKS building blocks** that support tailored **Competencies**, **Work Roles**, and **Teams**. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

---

## A1. Core Concepts (NICE TKS)

- **Task (T):** an activity directed toward achieving organizational objectives (business, technology, mission). Tasks describe **the work** and should use your org’s language. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
- **Knowledge (K):** a retrievable set of concepts within memory. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- **Skill (S):** the capacity to perform an observable action. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  

NICE explicitly frames **Tasks** as “the work” and **K/S** as attributes of “the learner,” and links them so learners demonstrate K/S to complete Tasks. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4} :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

> **Why TKS?** It gives a common, flexible language to describe work and workers, improving clarity across orgs, sectors, and education/training providers. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

---

## A2. Using and Creating TKS Statements

**Use existing TKS** from the NICE Resource Center; you can tailor associations (e.g., attach additional K/S to a Task) for your context. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  
**Create new TKS** when needed for your unique context — but don’t edit existing TKS text to preserve interoperability. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}

> NICE emphasizes **agility, flexibility, interoperability, and modularity** as design attributes. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}

---

## A3. Competencies (Assessment-Ready Bundles)

**Competencies** bundle the TKS needed to show someone can perform a coherent body of work — with an **assessment method** (e.g., lab, test, portfolio). You may tailor the **TKS included** for your context, but should **not change** the title/description of an existing NICE Competency; create a new one if wording must differ. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}

NICE shows concrete Competency examples (e.g., **Data Analysis**), including sample tasks/skills/knowledge and an assessment approach. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11} :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}

---

## A4. Work Roles (Work-Centered Groupings)

**Work Roles** group Tasks for which someone is responsible or accountable; the K/S needed flow **transitively** from the Tasks. This keeps roles flexible and avoids locking into static K/S lists. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}

- Keep Work Role names/descriptions stable for interoperability; create a **new role** rather than modifying an existing one. :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}  
- NICE R1 supports creating **new roles** and still permits using the **2017 role set** (maintained separately by NICE). :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}

---

## A5. Teams (Top-Down via Roles or Bottom-Up via Competencies)

- **Build Teams with Work Roles** (top-down from objectives/work to lifecycle phases to roles). NICE provides examples for secure SDLC and CSF-aligned cyber teams. :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16} :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}  
- **Build Teams with Competencies** (bottom-up when precise Tasks are unknown, but needed Competencies are known). :contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}

---

## A6. Doctrine ↔ NICE Crosswalk (How We Apply TKS)

| Doctrine Chapter | NICE Focus | How to Use TKS/Competencies |
|---|---|---|
| **People** | **GV.RR/PR.AT** in CSF (roles, resourcing, training) are realized by **Work Roles** and **Competencies** built from TKS. Use **existing** TKS → assemble **Competencies** → define **Work Roles** → set assessments. :contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19} :contentReference[oaicite:20]{index=20} |
| **Processes** | Convert process objectives into **Task statements** in org language; attach K/S; this becomes the operating “backlog” for capability. :contentReference[oaicite:21]{index=21} |
| **Capability** | Express each capability as a set of **Tasks** with embedded **K/S** and one or more **Competencies** (assessment-ready) to ensure team readiness. :contentReference[oaicite:22]{index=22} |
| **Governance** | Maintain **interoperability** by avoiding edits to existing TKS/Competency text; govern versions via the NICE Resource Center. :contentReference[oaicite:23]{index=23} |
| **Operationalizing** | Build **Work Roles** from Tasks (transitive K/S), then staff and measure proficiency via Competency assessments. :contentReference[oaicite:24]{index=24} |
| **Renewal** | Use the **improvement loop**: update Tasks and Competencies as the mission/tech changes; leverage the Resource Center for updates. :contentReference[oaicite:25]{index=25} |

---

## A7. Implementation Pattern (Five Steps)

1. **Identify Work** → Draft **Task** statements in your language (clear verb, no embedded objective). :contentReference[oaicite:26]{index=26}  
2. **Attach K/S** → Link the **Knowledge** and **Skill** statements learners need to complete each Task. :contentReference[oaicite:27]{index=27}  
3. **Bundle as Competency** → Group related TKS with an **assessment method** (lab, test, portfolio). :contentReference[oaicite:28]{index=28}  
4. **Assemble Work Roles** → Combine Tasks to define roles; K/S flow transitively from the Tasks. :contentReference[oaicite:29]{index=29}  
5. **Form Teams** → Top-down via **Work Roles** or bottom-up via **Competencies** depending on clarity of work. :contentReference[oaicite:30]{index=30} :contentReference[oaicite:31]{index=31}

---

## A8. Competency Template (Use in this Doctrine)

> Use this table structure (from NICE’s examples) to define Doctrine-aligned Competencies and their assessments. :contentReference[oaicite:32]{index=32}

**Competency Name:**  
**Description:**  
**Assessment Method:** (e.g., lab-based demo, exam, portfolio, live exercise)  
**Task Statements:** (list T#### or your local Task IDs)  
**Knowledge Statements:** (list K#### or local K IDs)  
**Skill Statements:** (list S#### or local S IDs)

> **Tip:** If you need different wording, **create a new Competency**; don’t edit an existing NICE Competency’s title/description to preserve interoperability. :contentReference[oaicite:33]{index=33}

---

## A9. Example Doctrine-Aligned Competencies (Notional)

> Replace with your org’s Tasks/K/S once you formalize them.

### A9.1 CTEM-Ready Defender (Notional)
- **Assessment:** Lab-based purple-team simulation  
- **Tasks:** Exposure discovery, validate detections, prioritize findings, orchestrate mitigations  
- **K:** Threat intel sources; detection engineering concepts  
- **S:** Log analysis; hypothesis-driven investigation; playbook authoring

### A9.2 Cloud-Secure Builder (Notional)
- **Assessment:** Hands-on build/review of IaC and controls  
- **Tasks:** Configure identity boundaries, data protections, telemetry by design  
- **K:** Cloud provider services; encryption modes  
- **S:** Cloud policy as code; misconfiguration analysis

> These are **local** examples. For official TKS and Work Roles, consult the **NICE Resource Center**. :contentReference[oaicite:34]{index=34}

---

## A10. Governance Notes for Maintainers

- **Version hygiene:** Keep your local TKS/Competency sets versioned; reference the NICE Resource Center for authoritative updates. :contentReference[oaicite:35]{index=35}  
- **Interoperability:** Avoid modifying **existing** TKS or **existing** Competency titles/descriptions; create new statements/competencies if your context demands. :contentReference[oaicite:36]{index=36} :contentReference[oaicite:37]{index=37}
- **Learner-centric view:** Remember NICE treats **everyone as a learner** (students, job seekers, employees) progressing across a lifecycle; align your training and career-pathing accordingly. :contentReference[oaicite:38]{index=38}

# Appendix — NIST CSF 2.0 Crosswalk

This appendix maps the **Enterprise Cyber Defense Doctrine** to the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0**.  
Use it as a reference when building Profiles (Current/Target), setting Tiers, and prioritizing work.

> **Scope:** CSF 2.0 Functions (GV, ID, PR, DE, RS, RC), Categories (e.g., GV.RM), and representative Subcategories where helpful.  
> **Notes:** The Doctrine is outcome-oriented and business-aligned; CSF is outcome taxonomy. Multiple-to-multiple mappings are expected.

## How to Use the Crosswalk

1. **Scope a Profile** (product line, business service, or threat scenario).  
2. **Bind Doctrine chapter goals** to the CSF Categories above.  
3. **Select Subcategories** as measurable outcomes; add your **Informative References** (e.g., 800-53, ISO 27001).  
4. **Set Tier targets** for GOVERN + the other Functions.  
5. **Run gap analysis → POA&M → Measure → Improve (ID.IM)**.

> **Source reference:** NIST CSF 2.0 (Feb 26, 2024) Functions, Categories, Subcategories; Profiles & Tiers.

- **Appendix D:** Glossary of Terms.

## Case Study Example (Notional)

**Scenario:** A global retailer detects ransomware spreading in its POS systems. 

- **Containment (Doctrine):** SOC analysts apply triage—contain POS systems regionally rather than globally to minimize business disruption.
- **Business Outcome:** Transactions in unaffected regions continue, protecting revenue streams.
- **Lesson:** Applying medical-triage style doctrine avoids unnecessary enterprise-wide shutdowns.

---

**Closing Thought:** A Cyber Defense Doctrine is not static—it is a **living covenant** between practitioners and the business. It ensures cybersecurity is not a blocker, but an enabler of mission success.

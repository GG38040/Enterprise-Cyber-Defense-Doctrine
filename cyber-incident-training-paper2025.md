# Abstract

Aviation treats safety as a continuous training problem: crews maintain **currency** through recurrent simulator sessions and checkrides on a defined cadence. This white paper adapts that discipline to cybersecurity incident response (IR), proposing a **recurrent, scenario-based training framework** for enterprise Security Operations Centers (SOCs) and retail-sector Managed Security Service Providers (MSSPs). The framework emphasizes **team-based execution**, **decision-making under stress**, **resource management**, and **communications discipline**, and it organizes skill reinforcement across four priority domains: **Identity**, **Network**, **Endpoint/Forensics**, and **Recovery & Third-Party Coordination**. We specify program governance, scenario design patterns, a 12-month curriculum, assessment metrics, and compliance mappings (NIST IR-2/IR-3; PCI-DSS 12.10.x), enabling leaders to operationalize currency as a measurable capability rather than an aspirational goal.

# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Motivation
Cyber threats evolve faster than static playbooks. Skill atrophy—especially in low-frequency, high-impact IR tasks—degrades response outcomes. Parallel industries (e.g., commercial aviation) mitigate such risks through **recurrent training** that preserves **muscle memory** and **crew coordination** for rare but catastrophic events. Cyber defense can realize similar gains by adopting a **currency** model grounded in regular, threat-informed simulation.

## 1.2 Scope
This paper targets **enterprise SOC leaders** and **individual incident responders** in **retail** and **retail-focused MSSPs**. It balances technical specificity with implementation simplicity, focusing on career-positive skill growth over punitive performance review.

## 1.3 Contributions
- A **currency model** for IR with biannual “checkrides,” quarterly scenario drills, and annual full-scale exercises.
- A **four-domain skill taxonomy** (Identity, Network, Endpoint/Forensics, Recovery/3rd Party).
- A **scenario design blueprint** aligned to MITRE ATT&CK tactics/techniques.
- **Governance and measurement** constructs for repeatability and continuous improvement.
- **Compliance alignment** notes for NIST SP 800-53 (IR-2/IR-3), NIST SP 800-61, and PCI-DSS 12.10.x.

# 2. Background & Design Principles

## 2.1 Crew Resource Management (CRM) as an Analogy
Aviation’s CRM improves safety via **structured communications**, **role clarity**, and **empowered cross-checks** under pressure. Translating CRM to IR yields:
- **Defined team roles** and **closed-loop comms** during incidents.
- **Psychological safety** so any analyst can surface anomalies or risk.
- **Standard phraseology** to reduce ambiguity.

## 2.2 Threat-Informed Training
Training must reflect real adversary tradecraft. Rotating scenarios across **MITRE ATT&CK** tactics closes exposure gaps, drives practical detections/mitigations, and keeps exercises relevant to current retail threats (e.g., ransomware pre-encryption footholds, POS/payment skimming, third-party/supply chain compromise).

## 2.3 Standards Alignment
The program is designed to evidence:
- **NIST SP 800-53 Rev.5 IR-2** (role-based IR training; simulated events) and **IR-3** (IR plan testing).
- **NIST SP 800-61** recommendations for exercises and lessons learned.
- **PCI-DSS 12.10.x** (plan, training, testing, 24/7 availability) for payment environments typical of retail.

# 3. Currency Model

## 3.1 Cadence
- **Quarterly Scenario Exercises (QX):** tabletop → functional (lab/cyber-range). Each quarter emphasizes one primary domain with a secondary cross-domain thread.
- **Biannual Checkrides (C6):** end-to-end technical plus command/comms assessment; pass/fail is *not* the goal—gaps inform coaching plans.
- **Annual Full-Scale Exercise (AFX):** enterprise-wide drill with IT, Legal, PR, Risk, MSSP, and critical vendors.

## 3.2 Team Roles (“Digital Fireteam”)
- **Commander / Incident Lead (IC):** threat validation, prioritization, tempo control, communications lead.
- **Endpoint Lead:** host isolation, EDR/forensics, persistence eradication.
- **Network Analyst:** C2/exfil detection, segmentation/blocks, lateral tracing.
- **Identity Defender:** auth anomalies, MFA/session hygiene, privilege governance.

Roles rotate each quarter to broaden leadership depth and redundancy.

## 3.3 Communications Discipline
- **Standard calls:** “Host *POS-03* isolated 14:32Z; RAM capture initiated.”
- **Timed check-ins:** 5-minute cadence during hot phases.
- **Closed-loop confirmation:** directives are acknowledged verbatim.
- **Open hazard reporting:** any member may pause for safety/risk concerns.

7. **Scale & Sustain:** Quarterly cadence, annual AFX, curriculum rotation, measured improvements.

---

# 10. Risk Considerations & Mitigations

- **Operational Disruption:** Use lab/segmented ranges; pre-approved change windows for production-adjacent tests.  
- **Data Sensitivity:** Synthetic data or masked logs; strict evidence handling procedures.  
- **Tool Drift:** Quarterly validation of collection pipelines and detections; include “tooling outage” injects.  
- **Burnout:** Emphasize learning over grading; celebrate wins; rotate roles; balance intensity across quarters.

---

# 11. Limitations

- **Fidelity vs Cost:** High-fidelity ranges demand investment; start with tabletop + targeted functional components.  
- **Transferability:** Not all lessons generalize across heterogeneous retail stacks; keep scenarios modular.  
- **Measurement Noise:** Environment and inject variance can skew timing metrics; focus on trends, not single events.

---

# 12. Future Work

- **Calibration Benchmarks:** Cross-org anonymized timing/quality benchmarks for IR currency.  
- **Automated Scenario Orchestration:** Infra-as-scenario (IaSc) to spin up targeted environments on demand.  
- **Human-Factors Telemetry:** Lightweight comms analytics (closed-loop rate, miscomms classification) to quantify CRM effects.  
- **Cloud-Native Scenarios:** Deeper coverage of SaaS/IdP, container, and serverless attack paths.

# 14. Conclusion

Recurrent, scenario-based training transforms incident response from a set of documents into a **living crew discipline**. By institutionalizing **currency**—a predictable cadence of realistic simulations, team role rotations, and rigorous debriefs—enterprise SOCs and retail MSSPs gain speed, precision, and confidence when it matters most. The program outlined here operationalizes that culture with practical governance, measurable outcomes, and clear alignment to prevailing standards. Make currency a requirement, not a hope—and turn “first time seen” into “already rehearsed.”

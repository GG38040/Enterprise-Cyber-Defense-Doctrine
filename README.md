# Enterprise Cyber Defense Doctrine Manual

## Overview
The **Enterprise Cyber Defense Doctrine Manual** is an open-source project designed to help organizations align cybersecurity outcomes directly with business objectives.  
It moves beyond tools and technologies, focusing instead on **first principles** — *People, Processes, and Capabilities* — to shape a resilient, business-aligned cyber defense posture.  

This repository provides a full manual in Markdown format, along with field-card style summaries for practitioners who need quick reference in the field.

## Why This Project?
Today’s cybersecurity industry often focuses heavily on vendor solutions, tools, and novelty technologies. While important, they don’t address the **foundational doctrine** needed to consistently achieve business-aligned outcomes.  

This project provides that foundation — a **living doctrine** that practitioners can adapt, adopt, and refine within their own enterprises.

---

## Structure
The manual is organized into chapters, each addressing a critical component of enterprise cyber defense:

1. **Philosophy & First Principles**  
2. **People – Workforce Development & Career Pathing**  
3. **Processes – Foundational Cybersecurity Outcomes**  
4. **Capability – Aligning Outcomes with Business Strategy**  
5. **Governance & Risk Alignment**  
6. **Operationalizing the Doctrine**  
7. **Continuous Renewal & Benchmarking**  

### Practitioner Field Cards
Each chapter includes **Field Cards** — concise, actionable checklists for quick use by cybersecurity practitioners and leaders.

## How to Use
